        <!-- section 4 content here -->
        <p>Stretching and flexibility exercises are important components of any workout routine. They can help improve your range of motion, reduce the risk of injury, and aid in recovery. Some examples of stretching and flexibility exercises include:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Hamstring stretches</li>
              <li>Quad stretches</li>
              <li>Calf stretches</li>
              <li>Shoulder stretches</li>
              <li>Chest stretches</li>
              <li>Back stretches</li>
              <li>Hip stretches</li>
              <li>Neck stretches</li>
              <li>Full-body stretching routines</li>
              <li>Pilates or yoga</li>
              <li>Foam rolling or using a massage ball to release muscle tension</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It's important to warm up before stretching to prevent injury and increase the effectiveness of your stretches. Dynamic warm-up exercises, such as walking or light jogging, can get your blood flowing and prepare your muscles for stretching. It's also important to listen to your body and not push yourself too far beyond your limits, as overstretching can lead to injury. Gradually increasing the intensity and duration of your stretching over time can help you improve your flexibility and prevent injury.</p>

          <h2>5.Nutrition and Hydration</h2>
        </header>
        <!-- section 5 content here -->
            <p>Nutrition and hydration are important components of a healthy lifestyle and can play a significant role in optimizing your workout routine. Adequate nutrition and hydration can help you perform at your best during exercise, as well as aid in recovery and injury prevention.</p>
            <p>Here are some key points to keep in mind regarding nutrition and hydration:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Before a workout, it's important to fuel your body with the right nutrients. Aim for a meal or snack that's high in carbohydrates and moderate in protein, and low in fat and fiber to avoid digestive discomfort. This can help provide energy for your workout and aid in muscle recovery.</li>
                <li>During a workout, it's important to stay hydrated to avoid dehydration and maintain performance. Drink water before, during, and after your workout, and consider an electrolyte replacement drink if you're exercising intensely for more than an hour.</li>
                <li>After a workout, it's important to refuel your body with protein and carbohydrates to aid in muscle recovery and replenish energy stores. Aim for a meal or snack within 30 minutes of completing your workout to optimize recovery.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In addition to fueling your body properly, it's important to listen to your body's hunger and thirst cues and prioritize hydration throughout the day. Drinking enough water and eating a balanced diet can not only support your exercise routine but also help improve overall health and well-being.</p>
